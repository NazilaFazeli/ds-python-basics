For example, if we're allowing a user of our program to have access to a data structure, one way to ensure that they won't mess with it (sometimes users do this out of malice, and we want to try and prevent it) is to make the structure **immutable**. There are many more reasons why immutability is a desired trait, and we will discuss plenty more of them throughout the rest of the course.\n",

Changing a variable, then, simply amounts to associating that name with a different thing in memory.\n",
